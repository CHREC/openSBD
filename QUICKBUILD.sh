# This script should be all that is needed to go from a new clone of openSBD to
# a running barebones cFE with integrated OpenSplice SBD, assuming all component
# prerequisites are installed. Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit.
#
# Note 1:
# It is recommended that the beginning section (OpenSplice compile) is done
# manually in case of build errors.
#
# Note 2:
# Enter target 21 (for x86.linux-release) when prompted during OpenSplice configure
